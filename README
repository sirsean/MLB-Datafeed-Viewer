This is a simple web page to display the results of the MLB-Datafeed-Parser using the Google Visualization API.

First, set up a file called "config.ini" with the relative path to your MLB-Datafeed-Parser output directory:

    path=/../../code/MLB-Datafeed-Parser/output/

Then, generate a file, over with the MLB-Datafeed-Parser:

    rake parse_team[2011-04-01,min,xml]

Get the filedate code out of the filename (which is printed by the previous rake task), and go to:

    /index.php?file=2011-06-05_14-04-57

You should see a nice graph.
